# Install additional packages often used in notebooks.
# Installing these at the system level helps with caching, since venvs can
# set --system-site-packages to use the already installed versions.

# Note:
#   * Packages relating to TensorFlow are pinned to versions close to what
#     Colab includes in its hosted runtimes. We don't need to match all of
#     Colab's dependencies, but we should at least make an effort for the ones
#     our notebooks use.
#   * We explicitly do *not* install Jupyter notebook requirements since they
#     should be installed within venvs.
