# C API bindings

IREE provides a low level C API for its runtime[^1], which can be used directly or
through higher level APIs and language bindings built on top of it.

API header files are organized by runtime component:

| Component header file                                                       | Overview                                                                  |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [iree/base/api.h](https://github.com/google/iree/blob/main/runtime/src/iree/base/api.h) | Core API, type definitions, ownership policies, utilities                 |
| [iree/vm/api.h](https://github.com/google/iree/blob/main/runtime/src/iree/vm/api.h)     | VM APIs: loading modules, I/O, calling functions                          |
| [iree/hal/api.h](https://github.com/google/iree/blob/main/runtime/src/iree/hal/api.h)   | HAL APIs: device management, synchronization, accessing hardware features |

The [samples/](https://github.com/google/iree/tree/main/samples)
directory demonstrates several ways to use IREE's C API.

## Prerequisites

To use IREE's C API, you will need to build the runtime
[from source](../building-from-source/getting-started.md). The
[iree-template-cpp](https://github.com/iml130/iree-template-cpp) community
project also shows how to integrate IREE into an external project using
CMake[^2].

## Concepts

By default, IREE uses its own tiny Virtual Machine (VM) at runtime to interpret
program instructions on the host system. VM instructions may also be lowered
further to LLVM IR, C, or other representations for static or resource
constrained deployment.

The VM supports generic operations like loads, stores, arithmetic, function
calls, and control flow. It builds streams of more complex program logic and
dense math into command buffers that are dispatched to hardware backends
through the Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) interface.

Most interaction with IREE's C API involves either the VM or the HAL.

<!-- TODO(scotttodd): diagrams -->

### IREE VM

* VM _instances_ can serve multiple isolated execution _contexts_
* VM _contexts_ are effectively sandboxes for loading modules and running
  programs
* VM _modules_ provide extra functionality to execution _contexts_, such as
  access to hardware accelerators through the HAL. Compiled user programs are
  also modules.

### IREE HAL

* HAL _drivers_ are used to enumerate and create HAL _devices_
* HAL _devices_ interface with hardware, such as by allocating device memory,
  preparing executables, recording and dispatching command buffers, and
  synchronizing with the host
* HAL _buffers_ and _buffer views_ represent storage and shaped/typed views
  into that storage (aka "tensors")

## Using the C API

### Setup

Include headers:

``` c
#include "iree/base/api.h"
#include "iree/hal/api.h"
#include "iree/vm/api.h"

// The VM bytecode and HAL modules will typically be included, along
// with those for the specific HAL drivers your application uses.
// Functionality extensions can be used via custom modules.
#include "iree/modules/hal/module.h"
#include "iree/hal/drivers/local_task/registration/driver_module.h"
#include "iree/vm/bytecode_module.h"
```

Check the API version and register components:

``` c
// Statically linking the runtime should never have version conflicts,
// however dynamically linking against a runtime shared object must
// always verify that the version is as expected.
iree_api_version_t actual_version;
IREE_CHECK_OK(iree_api_version_check(IREE_API_VERSION_LATEST, &actual_version));

// Modules with custom types must be statically registered before use.
IREE_CHECK_OK(iree_hal_module_register_types());

// Device drivers are managed through registries.
// Applications may use multiple registries to more finely control driver
// lifetimes and visibility.
IREE_CHECK_OK(iree_hal_local_task_driver_module_register(
    iree_hal_driver_registry_default()));
```

!!! tip
    The `IREE_CHECK_OK()` macro calls `assert()` if an error occurs.
    Applications should propagate errors and handle or report them as desired.

### Configure stateful objects

Create a VM instance along with a HAL driver and device:

``` c
// Applications should try to reuse instances so resource usage across contexts
// is handled and extraneous device interaction is avoided.
iree_vm_instance_t* instance = NULL;
IREE_CHECK_OK(iree_vm_instance_create(iree_allocator_system(), &instance));

// We use the CPU "local-task" driver in this example, but could use a different
// driver like the GPU "vulkan" driver. The driver(s) used should match with
// the target(s) specified during compilation.
iree_hal_driver_t* driver = NULL;
IREE_CHECK_OK(iree_hal_driver_registry_try_create(
    iree_hal_driver_registry_default(),
    iree_string_view_literal("local-task"),
    iree_allocator_system(), &driver));

// Drivers may support multiple devices, such as when a machine has multiple
// GPUs. You may either enumerate devices and select based on their properties,
// or just use the default device.
iree_hal_device_t* device = NULL;
IREE_CHECK_OK(iree_hal_driver_create_default_device(
    driver, iree_allocator_system(), &device));

// Create a HAL module initialized to use the newly created device.
// We'll load this module into a VM context later.
iree_vm_module_t* hal_module = NULL;
IREE_CHECK_OK(
    iree_hal_module_create(device, iree_allocator_system(), &hal_module));
// The reference to the driver can be released now.
iree_hal_driver_release(driver);
```

!!! tip
    The default `iree_allocator_system()` is backed by `malloc` and `free`,
    but custom allocators may also be used.

Load a vmfb bytecode module containing program data:

``` c
// (Application-specific loading into memory, such as loading from a file)

iree_vm_module_t* bytecode_module = NULL;
IREE_CHECK_OK(iree_vm_bytecode_module_create(
    iree_const_byte_span_t{module_data, module_size},
    /*flatbuffer_allocator=*/iree_allocator_null(),
    /*allocator=*/iree_allocator_system(), &bytecode_module));
```

!!! note
    Many IREE samples use
    [`c_embed_data`](https://github.com/google/iree/tree/main/build_tools/embed_data)
    to embed vmfb files as C code to avoid file I/O and ease portability.
    Applications should use what makes sense for their platforms and deployment
    configurations.

Create a VM context and load modules into it:

``` c
iree_vm_context_t* context = NULL;
iree_vm_module_t* modules[2] = {hal_module, bytecode_module};
IREE_CHECK_OK(iree_vm_context_create_with_modules(
    instance, IREE_VM_CONTEXT_FLAG_NONE,
    modules, IREE_ARRAYSIZE(modules),
    iree_allocator_system(), &context));
// References to the modules can be released now.
iree_vm_module_release(hal_module);
iree_vm_module_release(bytecode_module);
```

Look up the function(s) to call:

``` c
iree_vm_function_t main_function;
IREE_CHECK_OK(iree_vm_context_resolve_function(
    context, iree_string_view_literal("module.main_function"), &main_function));
```

### Invoke functions

<!-- TODO(scotttodd): I/O buffers (TODO pending new helpers) -->

``` c
// (Application-specific I/O buffer setup, making data available to the device)

IREE_CHECK_OK(iree_vm_invoke(context, main_function,
                             /*policy=*/NULL, inputs, outputs,
                             iree_allocator_system()));

// (Application-specific output buffer retrieval and reading back from the device)
```

### Cleanup resources

``` c
iree_hal_device_release(device);
iree_vm_context_release(context);
iree_vm_instance_release(instance);
```
