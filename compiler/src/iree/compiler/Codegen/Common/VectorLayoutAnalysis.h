/// The VectorLayoutAnalysis framework is a fixed point iteration analysis
/// that given some anchor points, tries to infer the layout of all values
/// in the program.
///
/// An anchor point is a MLIR Value fixed to a specific layout. Anchor points
/// must be provided by the user. The analysis itself does not have any
/// pre-existing anchor points to start with.
///
/// The analysis does not assume a specific layout, but instead the layout is
/// any Attribute that implements the VectorLayoutInterface.
///
/// The analysis provides a set of rules on operations, that are used to
/// infer the layout of the results and operands of an operation. These rules
/// are defined in the implementation of the analysis.
///
/// To start, the user must define some anchor points using `setAnchor`,
/// anchoring a layout to a specific value. The analysis can then be ran using
/// `run`, at which point it will use it's rules to infer other values in the
/// program. Example:
///
///    %root = vector.transfer_read
///      |
///      --> anchored to layout L
///    %root2 = vector.transfer_read
///    %c = arith.mulf %root, %b
///          |
///          --> %root, %b and %c must have the same layout
///    %e = arith.divf %b, %root2
///          |
///          --> %root2, %b and %e must have the same layout
///
/// Here, the user provided an anchor point for %root, fixing it's layout to L.
/// The layout then uses it's inference rules to find the layout of other
/// values:
///
///    %root = vector.transfer_read
///     |
///     --> infered to layout L
///    %root2 = vector.transfer_read
///     |
///     --> infered to layout L
///    %c = arith.mulf %root, %b
///     |
///     --> infered to layout L
///    %e = arith.divf %b, %root2
///     |
///     --> infered to layout L
///
/// If at any point, a value has a layout, but the user of that value requires
/// a different layout, the analysis inserts a resolution operation. This
/// resolution operation is `iree_vector_ext.layout_conflict_resolution`.
/// For Example:
///
/// %0 = vector.transfer_read
///  |
///  --> anchored to layout L
/// %1 = vector.transfer_read
///  |
///  --> anchored to layout L'
///  arith.addf %0, %1
///     |
///     --> %0 and %1 must have the same layout
///
/// To resolve the conflict, the analysis chooses one of the layouts, say
/// L, and inserts a resolution operation to convert the other layout to L.
///
/// %0 = vector.transfer_read
///  |
///  --> anchored to layout L
/// %1 = vector.transfer_read
///  |
///  --> anchored to layout L'
/// %resolved = iree_vector_ext.layout_conflict_resolution %1
///  |
///  --> infered to layout L
/// arith.addf %0, %resolved
///
/// The analysis itself will not try to resolve the conflict, but instead
/// leaves it to the user to resolve the conflict.
